PROJECT OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This project is a web-based diagnostic tool designed to 
analyze mean biopsy values to assist in cancer detection. 
The system utilizes a Deep Learning model (TensorFlow/Keras) 
integrated with a Flask web framework.

TECHNICAL STACK:
----------------
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Purple Theme)
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Deployment: Render (Cloud Hosting)
- Web Server: Gunicorn

URL: https://breast-cancer-prediction-sys.onrender.com/

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------
1. Navigate to the live link provided above.
2. Enter the mean values obtained from the biopsy report 
   (Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, and Smoothness).
3. Click "Run Analysis" to generate the prediction.
4. The system will process the data through the trained 
   neural network and return the diagnostic result.
